The code was based on libnds's arm7 code (see LICENSE below),
although it has been reworked with an eye on usability [*] purposes.

From The Free On-line Dictionary of Computing (27 SEP 03):
[*] usability
	The effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction
	with which users can achieve tasks in a particular environment
	of a product.  High usability means a system is: easy to learn
	and remember; efficient, visually pleasing and fun to use; and
	quick to recover from errors.
