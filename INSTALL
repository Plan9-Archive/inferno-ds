INSTALL
-------
After setting up Inferno [1] (see Inferno's INSTALL for instructions),
follow this instructions to install the DS port [2]:

% # INFERNO points to the root of the Inferno distribution
% INFERNO=/usr/inferno
% cd $INFERNO/os;
% svn co http://inferno-ds.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ ds
% cd ds
% cp dsinit.b ../init
% mk
% ls *.nds

The result of the compilation process is a usable .nds file,
which is ready to be copied to your flashcard and run.

REQUIREMENTS
------------
The conf file (see $CONF in mkfile) and build process can require files which
are not in a default Inferno install, these can be found in the root/ directory,
and should be copied to their corresponding locations.

External tools
--------------
Bootable images are generated using: ndstool & dsbuild utilities from devkitpro [3]:

- ndstool: used to build .nds files, for ds flashcards (slot1).
- dsbuild: used to build .nds.gba files, for gba flashcard (slot2) and a passme.

Place them in your shell's PATH, for example under: $INFERNO/$HOSTTYPE/$ARCH/bin
which should already be in your PATH as it contains all the tools (compilers, utils)
used by the Inferno build process.

Please note that this code does not use any nintendo intellectual property.
