Install the DS port code
========================

After setting up Inferno [1] (see Inferno's INSTALL for instructions),
follow this instructions to install the DS port [2]:

% # INFERNO points to the root of the Inferno distribution
% INFERNO=/usr/inferno
% cd $INFERNO/os;
% svn co http://inferno-ds.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ ds
% cd ds
% cp dsinit.b ../init
% mk
% ls *.nds

The result of the compilation process is a usable .nds file,
which is ready to be copied to your flashcard and be run.

To produce the .nds file the DS port requires the devkitpro [3] utilities ndstool & dsbuild,
you can place them in your shell's PATH, for example under $INFERNO/$HOSTTYPE/$ARCH/bin
which should be already in your PATH as it contains the compilers and utils needed by Inferno.

ndstool: is used to build a .nds file usuable with normal ds flashcards.
dsbuild: allows to make .nds.gba kernel files, loadable using a gba flashcard and a passme.

Please note that this code does not use any nintendo intellectual property.
